### PID-Steering Control ###

Submitted by - Vishal Rangras

##### PID Control implementation to compute steering angle of car using Cross Track Error. #####

The goals for this project are to:

1. Implement PID Controller initialization, updateError and totalError method in PID.cpp
2. Implement PID Control based steering of car in main.cpp
3. Tune Kp, Ki and Kd such that car stays in middle of track and complete the lap.
4. Try to increase top speed as much as possible by tuning the controller parameters.
